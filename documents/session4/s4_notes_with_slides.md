### Slide 4: Previous Topics
![API Alchemy_ Session 4 - 2023-10-26 07 43 43Part-4-1](https://github.com/rogers-obrien-rad/api-alchemy/assets/33231914/1994ee60-d194-474e-918b-9019ffa4f115)

1. **Python Basics**: A quick introduction to Python
2. **Python `requests` Library**: Methods to create, execute, and process HTTP requests
3. **Procore API in PYthon**: How we can access data from Procore with their API in Python

### Slide 5: Introduction to Python
![API Alchemy_ Session 4 - 2023-10-26 07 43 43Part-5-1](https://github.com/rogers-obrien-rad/api-alchemy/assets/33231914/353bd742-1d1f-4e1a-bc70-504e8da4455e)

### Slide 7: Basic Outputs
![API Alchemy_ Session 4 - 2023-10-26 07 43 43Part-7-1](https://github.com/rogers-obrien-rad/api-alchemy/assets/33231914/d6623187-969a-4cc4-8286-e4982c6642dc)

The print function in Python is used to display text or variable values in the console.
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

### Slide 9: Variables
![API Alchemy_ Session 4 - 2023-10-26 07 43 43Part-9-1](https://github.com/rogers-obrien-rad/api-alchemy/assets/33231914/6c1fe508-9e78-4995-8ed0-3c9a99f7e461)

#### Variables Types
Variables act as placeholders to store data values in memory. Different data types can be assigned to variables such as:
* String: Textual data
``` python
name = "Hagen"
```
* Integer: Whole numbers
```python
age = 29
```
* Float: Decimal numbers
``` python
height = 6.0
```
* Boolean: binary true or false (0 or 1)
```python
works_at_ro = True
```

> Unlike other languages, Python does not require you to declare the type of variable when declaring it. Python will figure out the variable type for you when you run your code. 

#### Variable Naming
* **Starting Character**: Variable names must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_). The rest of the name can contain letters, numbers, or underscores.
* **Case-Sensitive**: Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age, and AGE are three different variables).
* **Reserved Words**: Python has defined keywords like `if`, `else`, `while`, etc.) that cannot be used as variable names.

### Slide 10: Lists
![API Alchemy_ Session 4 - 2023-10-26 07 43 43Part-10-1](https://github.com/rogers-obrien-rad/api-alchemy/assets/33231914/9bbf186b-391e-441c-afe1-85d4a46064f7)

Lists are ordered collections of items, and they can hold any type of data.
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
```

Items in lists can be accessed by their index, with indices starting from 0 for the first item.
```
print(fruits[0])
```

### Slide 12: Dictionaries
![API Alchemy_ Session 4 - 2023-10-26 07 43 43Part-12-1](https://github.com/rogers-obrien-rad/api-alchemy/assets/33231914/6ff25a04-a692-42ad-a6b8-83ac5f40be9f)

Dictionaries in Python store data in key-value pairs and look very similar to JSON-formatted data:
```python
person = {
    "name": "Hagen",
    "age": 29,
    "city": "Austin"
}
```
Values in a dictionary can be accessed using their respective keys:
```python
print(person["name"]) # Hagen
print(person["age"]) # 29
```

### Slide 13: Advanced Outputs: F-Strings (Formatted String Literals)
![API Alchemy_ Session 4 - 2023-10-26 07 43 43Part-13-1](https://github.com/rogers-obrien-rad/api-alchemy/assets/33231914/89f14cb9-df4e-43f9-b252-9b06fb96fcbc)

Introduced in Python 3.6, f-strings offer a concise way to embed expressions inside string literals. They are prefixed with an 'f' and use curly braces {} to embed Python expressions within the string.

```python
name = "John"
age = 25
greeting = f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old."
print(greeting)  # Output: My name is John and I am 25 years old.
```

You can also perform operations within the curly braces of an f-string.

```python
double_age = f"Twice my age is {age * 2}."
print(double_age)  # Output: Twice my age is 50.
```

F-strings provide a readable and convenient way to include variable values and expressions directly within strings, making code cleaner and more intuitive.

### Slide 14: Conditionals
![API Alchemy_ Session 4 - 2023-10-26 07 43 43Part-14-1](https://github.com/rogers-obrien-rad/api-alchemy/assets/33231914/f81bd4f2-3ef1-4a80-bb83-755db08409d1)

Conditionals allow for the execution of a block of code only if a specified condition is met.
```python
if age > 18:
    print("John is an adult.")
else:
    print("John is not an adult.")
```

### Slide 15: Functions
![API Alchemy_ Session 4 - 2023-10-26 07 43 43Part-15-1](https://github.com/rogers-obrien-rad/api-alchemy/assets/33231914/5ba7445f-2440-4b2c-b2c1-c92d426d3142)

* **Definition**: Functions are blocks of organized and reusable code designed to perform a specific task. They are a fundamental concept in programming, allowing for modularity and code reuse.
```python
def function_name(parameters):
    """docstring: provides a brief explanation of what the function does, the input(s), and the output(s)"""
    # function body
    return output
```
* **Parameters and Arguments**
    * Parameters are the names listed in the function's definition.
    * Arguments are the real values passed to the function when it's called.
```python
def greet(person_name):
    message = f"Hello, {person_name}!"
    return message
```
* **Return Statement**: The return keyword is used to exit a function and return a value.

```python
def add(x, y):
    return x + y
```

* **Variable Scope**
    * Local Variables: Variables declared inside a function have a local scope, meaning they can only be accessed within that function
    * Global Variables:  Variables declared outside of the function (or in global scope) can be accessed inside or outside of the function
 
```python
x = 10  # This is a global variable

def check_value():
    y = 5  # This is a local variable
    return x + y  # Can access global variable 'x' inside this function
```

### Slide 16: Package Imports
![API Alchemy_ Session 4 - 2023-10-26 07 43 43Part-16-1](https://github.com/rogers-obrien-rad/api-alchemy/assets/33231914/74755503-60a0-482d-bc61-3fc3a0bfa33b)

In Python, we can enhance the default capabilities by importing external packages. This is done using the import keyword. In the script, two packages are imported:
* requests: Used for making HTTP requests.
```python
import requests
```
* pandas (often imported as pd): Used for data manipulation and analysis.
```python
import pandas as pd
```
### Slide 17: Python `requests` Library
![API Alchemy_ Session 4 - 2023-10-26 07 43 43Part-17-1](https://github.com/rogers-obrien-rad/api-alchemy/assets/33231914/a17b65b5-584e-48f2-9e36-cafef863f08f)

1. **HTTP Wrapper**: The requests library is a popular Python package used for making HTTP requests. It abstracts the complexities of making requests behind a simple API, providing an intuitive way to send HTTP requests and handle responses.
2. **Methods**: It supports all major HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., through simple method calls.
3. **Response Handling**: Responses from servers can be easily parsed, and the library provides convenient methods to extract useful information, such as `response.text`, `response.json()`, and `response.status_code`.

### Slide 18: POST Access Token in Procore
![API Alchemy_ Session 4 - 2023-10-26 07 43 43Part-18-1](https://github.com/rogers-obrien-rad/api-alchemy/assets/33231914/fe3a595b-a7ff-4b14-8a0f-a458553d48fc)

This snippet shows you how to create and access token for your Procore App

```python
client_id = os.getenv("CLIENT_ID")
client_secret = os.getenv("CLIENT_SECRET")

endpoint = "/oauth/token"

headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}

body = {
    "grant_type": "client_credentials",
    "client_id": client_id,
    "client_secret": client_secret
}

response = requests.post(
    url=f"{BASE_URL}{endpoint}",
    headers=headers,
    data=json.dumps(body)  # Convert the dictionary to a JSON string
)

access_token_data = response.json()
access_token = access_token_data["access_token"]
```

1. `client_id = os.getenv("CLIENT_ID")`: Retrieves the value of the environment variable "CLIENT_ID" and assigns it to the client_id variable.
2. `client_secret = os.getenv("CLIENT_SECRET")`: Retrieves the value of the environment variable "CLIENT_SECRET" and assigns it to the client_secret variable.
3. `endpoint = "/oauth/token"`: Specifies the endpoint for obtaining an OAuth token.
4. `headers = {...}`: Defines a dictionary that indicates the content being sent is in JSON format.
5. `body = {...}`: Constructs the data payload, including the grant type and the client's ID and secret credentials.
6. `response = requests.post(...)`: Sends a POST request to the composed URL (BASE_URL + endpoint), with the defined headers and the body converted to a JSON string.
7. `access_token_data = response.json()`: Parses the response, which is expected to be in JSON format, into a Python dictionary.
8 `access_token = access_token_data["access_token"]`: Extracts the value associated with the key "access_token" from the parsed response and assigns it to the access_token variable.

### Slide 19: GET All Companies
![API Alchemy_ Session 4 - 2023-10-26 07 43 43Part-19-1](https://github.com/rogers-obrien-rad/api-alchemy/assets/33231914/bc976a2f-c06b-44ea-a0d4-95d8102f2a0a)

This snippet gets the companies that the app has been downloaded to.

```python
endpoint = "/rest/v1.0/companies"

headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token}"}

response = requests.get(
    url=f"{BASE_URL}{endpoint}",
    headers=headers
)

company_data = response.json()

# save first (0th) "id" from the list which will correspond to RO
company_id = company_data[0]["id"]
```

1. `endpoint = "/rest/v1.0/companies"`: Specifies the endpoint for fetching company data.
2. `headers = {...}: Defines a dictionary containing an Authorization header, which uses the previously retrieved access_token.
3. `response = requests.get(...)`: Sends a GET request to the composed URL (BASE_URL + endpoint), with the defined headers.
4. `company_data = response.json()`: Parses the response, which is expected to be in JSON format, into a Python dictionary or list (based on the response structure).
5. `company_id = company_data[0]["id"]`: Extracts the "id" of the first (0th) company in the retrieved data list and assigns it to the company_id variable.

### Slide 20: GET All Projects within a Company
![API Alchemy_ Session 4 - 2023-10-26 07 43 43Part-20-1](https://github.com/rogers-obrien-rad/api-alchemy/assets/33231914/73fbda3c-3665-4571-b37a-1ecf163e543d)

This snippet pulls all the projects that have granted access to your app.

```python
endpoint = "/rest/v1.1/projects"

headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token}",
    "Procore-Company-Id": f"{company_id}"
}

params = {
    "company_id": f"{company_id}"
}

response = requests.get(
    url=f"{BASE_URL}{endpoint}",
    headers=headers,
    params=params
)

project_data = response.json()
```

1. `endpoint = "/rest/v1.1/projects"`: Specifies the endpoint for fetching project data.
2. `headers = {...}`: Defines a dictionary for headers, including the previously retrieved access_token for authentication and specifying which company's projects to fetch.
3. `params = {"company_id": f"{company_id}"}`: Sets up query parameters to include the company_id in the request.
4. `response = requests.get(...)`: Sends a GET request to the composed URL (BASE_URL + endpoint), using the headers and parameters defined.
5. `project_data = response.json()`: Parses the response, expected to be in JSON format, into a Python dictionary or list (based on the response structure).

### Create a GET request in Python (Slide 21)
Using [The Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/), create a GET request to get a random cat image.
* [Documentation}(https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/5578104/RWgqUxxh#997f5b37-79cc-49a4-8c11-ddf24b72a4d9) on the `/images/search` endpoint
* The code you will complete is below:

```python
def get_image():
    """
    Gets a random cat image

    Link to Documentation: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/5578104/RWgqUxxh#997f5b37-79cc-49a4-8c11-ddf24b72a4d9
    """

    # Define the full URL
    get_url = ""

    # Define the header(s)
    # Use the following API Key: live_NMNC1lcbODoViW3HxtYkiIstzdDd8wN2e8tlHLM6QyDGSKTA1NUGGdqEGP7UOoBm
    get_headers = {}

    # Create the request using the correct method from the requests library
    #response = 

    # Print the URL to the image
    print("Challenge 1: Below is the URL to a random cat image")
    print(response.json()[0]["url"])
```

#### Some Help:
1. Define the `get_url` string variable using the full URL available in the documentation under the endpoint (should start with "https")
2. Define the `get_headers` dictionary variable. You need only one header related to the API Key which is provided in the code.
3. Create the GET request using the `requests.get()` function. For this request, you only need to provide values for the `url` and `headers` input parameters.

### Create a POST request in Python (Slide 22)
Use [The Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/) to create a POST request that likes an image.
* [Documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/5578104/RWgqUxxh#ae1b5e8f-ca63-4de8-a715-f4944f4cec07) on the `/favourites` endpoint
* The [image](https://cdn2.thecatapi.com/images/h-bMdWYmd.png) you will be liking - that is the Chicken Nugget
* The code you will complete is below:

```python
def favorite_image():
    """
    Favorites a cat image

    Link to Documentation: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/5578104/RWgqUxxh#ae1b5e8f-ca63-4de8-a715-f4944f4cec07
    """

    # Define the full URL
    post_url = ""

    # Define the header(s)
    # Use the following API Key: live_NMNC1lcbODoViW3HxtYkiIstzdDd8wN2e8tlHLM6QyDGSKTA1NUGGdqEGP7UOoBm
    post_headers = {}

    # Define the data to send. You need to only use the `image_id` key and use the ID: h-bMdWYmd
    post_data = {}

    # Create the request using the correct method from the requests library
    #response = 

    # 
    print("Challenge 2: You should get a 'SUCCESS' message below")
    print(response.text)
```

#### Some Help:
1. Define the `post_url` string variable using the full URL available in the documentation under the endpoint (should start with "https")
2. Define the `post_headers` dictionary variable. You need only one header related to the API Key which is provided in the code. This should match what you did before in the GET request.
3. Define the `post_data` dictionary variable which will include a key called `image_id` with a value of `h-bMdWYmd`.
4. Create the POST request using the `requests.post()` function. For this request, you need to provide three values: the `url`, the `headers`, and the `json` input parameters. For the `json` parameter, you will provide the data you created earlier.
