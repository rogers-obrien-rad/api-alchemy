# Creating a Postman Account
The sign-up process is rather straight-forward, but we wanted to make sure everything was crystal clear!

## SIGN UP PROCESS
1. Navigate to the Postman website (https://www.postman.com) and click the button in the top right corner to create an account.
2. You can use any email account you like. If you have a Gmail account that you would like to use, you can streamline the sign-up by clicking the "Sign up with Google" button. **You cannot sign in with SSO** so simply avoid that option.

Your username cannot contain any spaces and has to be unique so be creative!

 3. You will be asked to include some information about your name and title. This information won't affect your Postman experience so feel free to be as accurate as you like.

 4. After clicking continue, you will be taken to your workspace and you will be given a little welcome message.
